# Testing JavaScript

## Installation

Install [node](http://nodejs.org). Navigate to the folder containing this `README.md` and run `npm install` on the command to install the dependencies.

If either of these steps fails, don't panic! You can still complete all the exercises using the browser test runner.

## Folders

- `slides`: open slides/index.html to view the slides for the class
- `vendor`, `node_modules`: libraries
- `exercises`: in class exercises
- `exercises/node-skeleton`: a skeleton nodejs test setup, with mocha, chai and sinon
- `exercises/browser-skeleton`: a skeleton browser test setup, with mocha, chai and sinon
